# Techy

I have developed a mobile application using React Native and JavaScript.

This app is designed to allow job seekers (like myself), especially those in the tech fields, to discover a wide range of job opportunities. 

Functionalities:
1. Users can explore job listings for full-time, part-time, and contract positions tailored to their preferences. 
2. Provides user-friendly interface for searching where they can browse through various listings.
3. Users can access crucial job information including: 
    - Qualifications required for applying
    - Detailed job responsibilities
    - Insights about the hiring company
    - An apply button is present for each job listing. When users are ready to apply, they can simply tap this button and be redirected to the respective job application page on the web.
